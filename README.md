We test whether economic activity shocks create cascading returns across equities, commodities, and digital assets, 
and find such ripple effects are largely absent. Analyzing the S&P 500,
Microsoft, Ethereum, and WTI crude oil from 2018 to 2025, we examine if changes in funda-
mental activity like earnings, network fees, or consumption trigger self-exciting price dynamics. Our frame-
work combines predictive regressions with impulse response analysis to model these effects.

While activity shocks produce large same-day price adjustments ranging from -118 to +121
basis points, we find no statistically significant evidence of forward propagation in any of the
asset classes. Predictive regressions confirm this, showing that activity metrics add little ex-
planatory power. 

These findings challenge the hypothesis that activity-based branching is a
universal market feature. Our evidence suggests that diverse markets, from complex equi-
ties to supposedly inefficient cryptocurrencies, incorporate information with remarkable and
near-instantaneous efficiency.
